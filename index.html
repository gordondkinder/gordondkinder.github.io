He has appeared before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and has handled

in patent infringement cases, copyright infringement cases, theft of trade 
secrets cases, breach of employment contract matters, and trademark infringement 
and product disparagement matters.</p>

<p>Gordon has worked in many technologies, including:</p>
<ul>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>Case Western Reserve University (BSME with Honors, 1973)</p>
<p>Case Western Reserve University School of Law (J.D., 1977)</p>

<h3>Representative Experience</h3>

<p>Gordon has handled patent and trademark matters for numerous Fortune 500 
companies as well as for privately held businesses and startups.</p>

<ul> 
  <li>Represented a manufacturer of commercial electrical fasteners against a 
  new competitor that was using his client’s part numbers on inferior products. 
  The infringement was stopped prior to trial.</li>
  
  <li>Obtained patents for a client in the marine accessories business, then 
  prosecuted a series of infringement actions against imitators, preserving his 
  client’s market dominance.</li>

  <li>Obtained a patent for a manufacturer of containers used for international 
  shipping of liquids under pressure. The improvement decreased the tare weight 
  of the container by more than 2000 lbs., and immediately gained wide market acceptance. Because all 
  such containers must be able to move freely in international commerce 
  (including the U.S.), the U.S. patent alone has proven sufficient to protect 
  the world wide market in such containers.</li>
  
  <li>Obtained an <i>ex parte</i> seizure order against a T-shirt counterfeiter 
  and accompanied the U.S. Marshalls on the raid, confiscating thousands of 
  dollars of counterfeit merchandise and the equipment used to make it.</li> 
</ul>
